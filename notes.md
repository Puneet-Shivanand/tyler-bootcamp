react bootcamp notes

function composition

function getProfilePic(uname){
    return 'https://photo.fb.com/ '+uname
}


unidirectional data flow
components compose them get the ui
jquery update event handler update dom
react state lives inside the component, it is responsible for rendering the ui


explicit mututaions
setState

redux -> reducers
just javascript

shared mutable states
    views share the same state component 

component
    A function or class which optionally accepts input and returns a react element.
